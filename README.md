Regression models are evaluated using Test Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Classification models are evaluated using Test Accuracy score. 

Results of Baseline (with no hyperparameter tuning) models:

Linear Regression: 4,116,343,495 --> I need to look further into linearity, homoscedasticity and independence.

K Neighbors Regressor: 44.2

Random Forest Regressor: 28.7


Logistic Regression: 0.74

K Neighbors Classifier: 0.73

Random Forest Classifier: 0.80
